They are often inhumanly fast, or will submit forms hours, days, or even weeks after the form was first scraped off the web. The Event Espresso Bot Trap will send a timestamp with the Ticket Selector form when it is submitted. By default, this timestamp is encrypted so that the spam bots can not change it, but encryption may cause issues on some servers due to configuration \"conflicts\". If you continuously get caught in the bot trap, then try setting this option to \"No\". This may increase the number of spam submissions you receive, but increases server compatibility."
